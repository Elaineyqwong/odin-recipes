    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      My grandma's old-fashioned banana pudding recipe was always something she
      made from memory, but I let her talk it out so I could write it down. She
      ran a country club and restaurant in her day; she can make amazing food,
      but she doesn't measure anything and makes most foods from memory.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Pudding:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, separated, divided</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package vanilla wafers, divided</li>
        <li>4 medium bananas, sliced, or more to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Meringue:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
      Make the pudding: Combine sugar, flour, and salt in a bowl. Set egg whites
      aside for meringue.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
      Beat egg yolks in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar mixture
      alternately with milk and vanilla, stirring constantly. Bring to a simmer
      and cook until slightly thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Add butter; continue
      stirring until thickened to a pudding-like consistency, 5 to 7 minutes
      more.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
      Line the bottom of a baking dish with 1/2 of the wafers. Layer 1/2 of the
      banana slices over wafers and cover with 1/2 of the pudding. Repeat layers
      once more.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>
      Make the meringue: Beat reserved egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic
      bowl, gradually adding cream of tartar, until soft peaks form. Add sugar
      and continue beating on high speed until stiff peaks form. Fold in
      vanilla. Spoon meringue over pudding.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>
      Bake in the preheated oven until meringue browns, 15 to 20 minutes. Let
      cool before serving.
